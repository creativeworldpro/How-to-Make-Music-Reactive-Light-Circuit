In this project, we’ll teach you a music reactive light circuit. The circuit can be able to react to the listener and her or his environment in real-time. The circuit worked base on the music that is playing. These lights do not play their own music or act as speakers.

They include microphones that transmit to sound to the light, which includes smart technology that reacts to the music.

The LED light can hear sounds and music nearby and will dance to the rhythm. This project enhances the user’s music listening experience by not only adding but also synchronizing visuals to the music. In this method as long as the microphone works properly and the music mode on the strips is turned on, the music sync LED strip lights will pulsate to the rhythm.


Component List -

To make this 5v power supply circuit, we might need some electronics component.

You can order your assembled SMT circuit form JLCPCB.

All components list have been given below –

1.	PCB – made by JLCPCB

2.	IC – CD 4017 BE

3.	Transistor – BD136, BC547, BC557

4.	Triac – BT 136

5.	Resistor – 1KΩ, 220 Ω, 68KΩ, 100kΩ

6.	MIC

7.	Holder

8.	AC Cable

9.	Filament Bulb

10.	Power Source DC 12v



Feature of CD4017 -

•	High speed 16 pin CMOS Decade counter

•	Supports 10 decoded outputs

•	Wide supply voltage range from 3V to 15V, typically +5V

•	TTL compatible

•	Maximum Clock Frequency: 5.5Mhz

•	Available in 16-pin PDIP, GDIP, PDSO packages



Application of CD4017 - 

•	Used in LED matrix, LED chaser and other LED projects

•	Binary counter or Binary decoder

•	Can be used for divide by N counting

•	Remote metering, automotive, medical electronics


Circuit Connection – Step 1

To make this music reactive circuit, we connect BC547 transistor collector leg with Base leg of BC557 transistor. Then we connect BC547 transistor base leg with positive leg of Mic and connect BC547 transistor emitter leg with negative leg of Mic. 

Now we need to connect 68 KΩ resistor with emitter leg of BC557 transistor and connect 1 KΩ resistor with base leg and emitter leg of BC557 transistor. Then connect 100 KΩ resistor with emitter leg of BC547 transistor and collector leg of BC557.
 
 
Circuit Connection – Step 2

This time we need to connect BC557 transistor collector leg with 14 leg of CD-4017 IC and connect 4no and 15no leg of CD-4017 IC.

It is time to connect CD-4017 IC 13no leg with emitter leg of BC547 transistor. We also need to connect 13no and 8no leg of CD-4017 IC.

Our circuit is now completely ready for use. Now need to connect a Triac with the circuit. Connect triac “T1” terminal with 8no leg of CD-4017 IC. 


Circuit Connection – Step 3

Now we need to connect a 220 Ω resistor with the circuit. We connect this resistor with 2no leg of CD-4017 IC and connect its other terminal with “G” terminal of triac. Since it is an AC bulb music active circuit, for that we need to connect an AC bulb with the circuit.

Connect AC bulb one terminal with “T2” terminal of triac and AC bulb other terminal with 220 volt AC line.
Then connect AC voltage other terminal with 8no leg of CD-4017 IC. Now need to connect DC-9v power supply with the circuit. We connect DC-9v positive cable with “Emitter” leg of BC557 transistor and DC-9v negative cable with 13no leg CD-4017 IC.


Now just, plug-in power and put Mic beside the sound system and connect AC bulb with the holder. Enjoy the effect of music reactive light circuit.
